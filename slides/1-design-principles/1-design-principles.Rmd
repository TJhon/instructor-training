## Designing code snippets for teaching

- Write it out to your heart's desire and polish it

--

- Then, split into three parts:
  - `r emo::ji("package")` **Pre-process:** Required, but isn't directly connected to / far off from learning goals of current lesson
  - `r emo::ji("broken_heart")` **Stash:** Not required, and not directly connected to learning goals of current lesson 
    - Likely concepts that fit better into future lessons)
  - `r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` **Feature:** Heart of the lesson (and maybe a review of a previous lessons)
  
- Finally, decide on the pace at which to scaffold and layer

## One other way to "leverage the ecosystem"

Do it all in R!

- Slides with **xaringan**
- Course website with **blogdown**
- Course notes / textbook with **bookdown**
- A student dashboard with **flexdashboard**
- Git automation with **ghclass**
- Interactive tutorials with **learnr**
- ...

.take-home[
- Go to RStudio Cloud ([rstd.io/rit-cloud](https://rstd.io/rit-cloud)) > **1 - Design Principles** > `start-with-cake.Rmd`.
- Challenge: Go from zero to data visualisation in 15 minutes of your first class. Assume students have successfully landed in RStudio Cloud like you did earlier. Design an exercise for them to "create" their first visualisation.
- Need inspiration? Use the `ggplot2::diamonds` or `dplyr::starwars` dataset or any dataset from `nycflights13` or `gapminder` packages.
- Already have a first day exercise you like? You're welcomed to modify it to fit the challenge.
