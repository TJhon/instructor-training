The following code is used to create the multivariate visualisation we saw earlier. How much of the code would you show/hide when **just starting teaching ggplot2**?

Discuss with your breakout group.

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(unvotes)
```

```{r unvotes-multivariate, fig.height=8}
un_votes %>%
  filter(country %in% c("United States of America")) %>%
  inner_join(un_roll_calls, by = "rcid") %>%
  inner_join(un_roll_call_issues, by = "rcid") %>%
  mutate(
    importantvote = ifelse(importantvote == 0, "No", "Yes"),
    issue = ifelse(issue == "Nuclear weapons and nuclear material", "Nuclear weapons and materials", issue)
    ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = importantvote, fill = vote)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  facet_wrap(~ issue, ncol = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "How the US voted in the UN",
    subtitle = "By issue and importance of vote",
    y = "Important vote", x = "", fill = "Vote"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
